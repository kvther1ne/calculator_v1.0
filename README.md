# calculator_v1.0

## Implementation of SmartCalc v1.0.

In this project I implemented an extended version of the usual calculator, which can be found in the standard applications of each operating system in the C programming language using structured programming. In addition to basic arithmetic operations such as add/subtract and multiply/divide, it can calculate arithmetic expressions by following the order, as well as some mathematical functions (sine, cosine, logarithm, etc.).
Besides calculating expressions, it also supports the use of the x variable and the graphing of the corresponding function.

The SmartCalc v1.0 program implemented:
- The program built with Makefile which contains standard set of targets for GNU-programs: all, install, uninstall, clean, dvi, dist, test, gcov_report
- Prepared full coverage of modules related to calculating expressions with unit-tests using the Check library
- GUI implementation, based on Qt
